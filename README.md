Computer Science Assignments written by Zachary Easterbrook for various classes.

In a lot of cases, assignments may be documented. It is not expected everything
may run as it "should", these are simply things I turned in for marks, and in 
nearly all cases I have gotten 100% on these assignments.

Things to note:
-It is not guarenteed that this code is written in the most efficient manner.
-In rare cases, I have modified the assignments afterwards as a bit of a joke.
  (See assignment 4 in the C directory. This is not what I turned in and is not
  intended to be readable)
